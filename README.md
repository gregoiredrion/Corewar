# 42 Corewar
Corewar is a school project developed by 42 school
The idea behind the project is to virtually create an arena for champions to fight in
This project consists in two parts, the ASM and the VM.
The ASM is an asm compiler that creates a binary file terminated by .cor from an asm file called a champion.
The VM executes the binary code in a "Virtual Machine" and displays how the fight between the champions goes out

## Usage
Use the make command to compile

ASM :
./asm file\
Compiles an asm file int a .cor file

VM :
./corewar gives you usage
- -v for visual display

Compiles .cor file(s) and runs a battle between the champions
